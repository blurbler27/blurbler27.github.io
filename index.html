I'm retired, living in Sugar Land, Texas.  I don't have much to go on
this web page at present (I love my family, but don't know if they want their
pictures scattered everywhere!).  Maybe more later!
</p>
<p>
Since I like languages, one of my personal projects was learning
Latin, through self-study and some on-line courses offered by
<a href="https://pages.saturalanx.eu/satura-lanx/"> Satura
Lanx (recommended!)</a>.  For fun, I wrote a simple Javascript
function for writing dates in the ancient Roman style (e.g., Feb. 24,
2020 would be the 6th day before the Kalends of March, and so would
the 25th!)  A link to a web page incorporating the function can be
found above.  If anyone wants it so they can  modify it, I
incorporated the Javascript in the HTML so there's only one thing to
download.
</p>
<p>
Other converters can be found on the web, but this is a simple one
that can be found in one file.  (Just look at the page source after
clicking the link.)
</p>
<p>
I'm constitutionally unable to write pretty web pages, so suggestions
for improvement are appreciated.
